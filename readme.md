# Add Interactivity to Homework from Day 02

In this lab we'll add some Interactivity to the homework from [day 02](https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/site-recreation).

You *should* have a site which looks kinda like a website you like. Right?

In your repo, create a new branch labeled `day-04-homework` and begin adding interactivity using the DOM event handlers which were discussed in [day 04 module 02](https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-01-controlling-the-dom/day-04/module-02/readme.md).

## Minimum Requirements

* Two `onclick` handlers.
* One `onscroll` handler.
* One other handler.

## Minimum Viable Product

* Try to emulate a behavior seen on the site you recreated.
* Consider using `animate`.
